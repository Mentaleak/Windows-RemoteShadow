## RDP Shadow Issues
- Multiple concurrent local logins.
- Shadowing requires specification of the current session.
  -	If there are multiple concurrent sessions on a workstation then you need to specify which one to connect to.
  - Options:
    1.	Use GPO to limit concurrent connections
    2.	Enable WSManagement service so that you can detect concurrent connections. 

The code for detecting concurrent sessions is already in source and just not in the GUI at this time.
